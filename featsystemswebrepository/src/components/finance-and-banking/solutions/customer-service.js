                                    <li>Most of the Services provided by Banking or Financial companies are similar. But, how will these companies provide differentiated services to the customers? Well, the only solution to stand against the competition is to deliver satisfying customer services. If a customer finds that the company services are easy for banking, investing and purchasing financial products, the company not only secures a permanent place in the existing customerâ€™s mind but also attracts a lot of new customers.</li>
                                    <li>In theory, this may seem like a very easy technique but trying to achieve this manually is a very time-consuming and costly process.</li>
                                    <li>Hence, RPA solutions can provide such companies a very cost-effective way to handle their customers with their 24*7 availability and error-free features. Bot performing repetitive tasks similar to humans can be best exploited in the Grievance Redressal process. The bots can collect data of the disputed transaction and hand over to the concerned department.</li>
