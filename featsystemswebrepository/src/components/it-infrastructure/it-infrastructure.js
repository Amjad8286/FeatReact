With Windows server management in place, a company can monitor server security to user management, SQL management, initial server setups, and server migration. Windows server management is again a very time-consuming task that seeks error-free output. With integrating RPA into the management, a large number of servers can be monitored in less time and more accuracy. For example, the server migration process is a very tedious job that requires the proper transfer of data. If a virtual bot is used for such a migration process, it can easily migrate all the servers as per the rules and guidelines in a time-efficient process.' },
        { id: 2, title: 'Database management', content: 'Database management is an interface between data and the end-users. This interface can be used for storing userâ€™s data, retrieving data, adding, updating deleting, or altering the data while taking appropriate security measures. When there is a huge volume of data to be stored, the amount of manual processing becomes too tiring and can lead to risky errors. With RPA in the picture, data repository tasks like data cleansing, normalization, data wrangling, etc. can be handled with ease and with more efficiency. Also, such data related tasks require special treatments for different situations which marks the importance of a bot even more significant. Say, for example, if we want to create an employee database for our company, a simple bot can help update the data, retrieve the data as and when required, and alter the data as per requirements, making the complex process easy to handle along with time-saving and accurate results.' },
        { id: 3, title: 'Storage management', content: 'Storage management is a software solution that optimizes the use of storage devices which can be either a hardware or IT system, from desktop computers to mainframes to large server networks. Along with this, it also protects the integrity of the data for any media covering aspects of security, virtualization, or more. As the process seems to be very complex, robots can help the operating system map files into physical media and access such files via the storage devices. Robots can help reduce labor costs, improve the quality of data storage, and reduce the turnaround time making the entire storage management more efficient.' },
        { id: 4, title: 'Network management', content: 'By keeping your computer network healthy, you can keep your business healthy. This is exactly what Network management helps you with. It is a software for administering and managing computer networks providing services like fault analysis, performance management, provisioning of networks, and maintaining the quality of service. But the challenges faced by Network management is handling the complex process to achieve an error-free network. Also, it should work with multiple network management tools making this whole process even more complex. The main functionality of RPA bot is to handle such a complex process and make the entire management system easy and error-free. This process becomes cost-effective and qualitative with bots taking care of the networks.' }
