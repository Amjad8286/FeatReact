                                    <li>The insurance Industry fights against risks daily. Each application filled or each data that should get recorded and has to be securely saved and authorized by multiple approvals. Such a secure industry faces numerous challenges. Its primary focus is to build high-growth and dynamic business, but it should very much concentrate on minimizing risks, sustainably, and reducing the overall cost.</li>
                                    <li>When we talk about the role of the customer, it has changed over time. The classic example of an insurance customer resembles that of any other customers who act connected, informed, and sophisticated. But, for an insurance company, their customers demand a high-speed yet transparent customer-oriented processing. Also, they seek services that would get offered with consistent quality across multiple channels.</li>
                                    <li>The aging IT systems can hardly meet this combination of domain functionalities and customer needs. Due to such demanding compliance requirements, IT systems have increased the complexity and rigidity in their solutions, which either lead to dissatisfaction of customers or exceedingly high financial and operational risk. Also, developing an entirely new solution becomes unsustainable for insurers. To deal with such challenges, Insurance companies have to find appropriate solutions that are not only cost-effective but also require a significant change in IT architecture.</li>
