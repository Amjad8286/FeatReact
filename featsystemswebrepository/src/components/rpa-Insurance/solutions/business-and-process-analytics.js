                                    <li>The only way a business can improve is when it can measure what it is doing and take corrective actions. Even for Insurance companies, there are measuring techniques that help them analyze their current scope of work. When such techniques that get combined with RPA, the result is bound to be satisfactory.</li>
                                    <li>RPA analytics consists of tools and techniques for identification, interpretation, and communication of data patterns which talks about the performance and health of an automated Insurance process. It can also get used to identifying patterns of data that help make decisions related to changing or improving existing RPA solutions.</li>
                                    <li>A bot can easily track and record processes or patterns at every step. A robot would quickly give a walk-through on all transactions processed along with the details of exceptions that get encountered. Having RPA in the picture will, for sure, improve the process and reduce the workload from the staff along with making the customers happy and satisfied.</li>
                                    <li>If we were to combine the scope of RPA with data analytics, we can quickly recognize the bottlenecks in the Automation process and take corrective actions wherever required.</li>
                                    <li>The RPA tool can handle large volumes of data. It can visualize the data clearly, which would help in interpreting the results. These benefits can help an organization come up with quick decisions about their workflow with proper justification of data.</li>
