                                    <li>Legacy Systems are programs that contain the data of the entire company. These sometimes considered as the foundation of all the business processes within the organization. When such systems become too much to handle, or they do not cater to the current customer needs, the company has to replace the system. A total replacement can be an option, but the company has to look at it from the feasibility perspective also.</li>
                                    <li>If the company is thinking of replacing the system, it may take several years to replace old, obsolete technology with new current systems. During this process of replacement, the company should ensure that there is not even a slight possibility of data loss. As they say, the show must go on. Similarly, the employees and customers should be able to access the data as and when required.</li>
                                    <li>One solution to all these problems is to use Robotic Process Automation (RPA) for handling the replacement procedure. RPA comes into handy if the company requires a quick solution to outsmart its competitors, an in-house solution with complete control of the company, or to replace some ancient legacy systems used by many government departments. RPA not only provides quick and time-saving solutions but guarantees 100% accuracy with the data migration and smooth flow of the existing process. Even though RPA cannot solve all the problems of replacement of legacy systems, it definitely can be used to replace many processes related to replacement.</li>
