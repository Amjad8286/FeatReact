                                    <li>Since the task has a high volume of data and consumes time. So, for the employee, it is more difficult to handle and complete this high-volume manual effort accurately on time.</li>
                                    <li>As we know for airlines, customer satisfaction is a great concern. Due to delays this impacting the customer service, damaging brand reputation, and leading to fines for non-compliance.</li>
                                    <li>Therefore, it is important for airline companies to adopt RPA as it provides just what aviation aspires for in this current environment.</li>

                                    <li>Robotic Process Automation aka RPA is another type of automation technology that can be very useful to airlines. It can be a helping hand to carry out or remove repetitive, time-consuming activities involved in the processes. For example, flight ticket cancelations and reservations management, providing refunds, generate tickets before boarding, and more.</li>
                                    <li>This will allow the airline service to attract more customers by giving them a nice experience so to visit or travel more than once.</li>
                                    <li>Also, can be utilized for regulatory compliance. Various airlines are governed by separate boards so compliance with the rules can also be difficult. But RPA is recognized for its high performance in process accuracy and enables businesses to comply quickly and effectively.</li>
                                    <li>Thus, implementing RPA software robots into the flight experience can remove all the customer's pain points associated with airline travel.</li>
