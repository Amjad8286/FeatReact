                                    <li>Healthcare management involves various workflows which include managing and coordinating healthcare units, managing case and utilization, remote monitoring, and managing population wellness. Even though most of the activities in the workflow are routine based repetitive tasks, they are majorly handled by the human workforce. As manual workflow is prominent in such workflows, the company can witness human errors and prolonged time to complete the task reducing the overall efficiency of the process.  </li>
                                    <li>But what if we replace humans with a robot to handle workflow management? RPA in healthcare management can centralize and streamline different activities with cost-effective and accurate results. Robots show their competency in handling rule-based processes. Hence, by implementing the RPA process, the efficiency of the company is bound to increase. With all such tasks taken care of by Robots, a healthcare professional can focus more on patient care and other critical activities resulting in improved customer service.</li>
                                    <li>The Healthcare industry comprises of both structured and unstructured data. Hence, using only the RPA process may not lead to the expected result. But, if the Intelligent Automation System (IPA) is used along with RPA, the result will be more than desirable. By making use of cognitive technologies and Machine Learning algorithms, IPA can handle the decision-making process better and become more beneficial for the business overall.</li>
