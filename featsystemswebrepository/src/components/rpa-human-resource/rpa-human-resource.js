With Chatbots in place, an employee can easily gain an understanding of many policies and benefits. He can also get his queries answered along with providing feedback. Time is what matters when the relationship comes into the picture. This can be easily taken care of by robots.' },
        { id: 2, title: 'Training and Development', content: 'Virtual classrooms can be used to train employees. Training new employees is a repetitive process in an organization. Hence, with Robot enhanced classroom sessions, this task becomes less cumbersome. Also, tracking the employee’s attendance and their progress is easier with virtual classrooms' },
        { id: 3, title: 'Recruiting and Hiring', content: 'The best use of HR Automation lies in Recruitment. Hiring an employee is a one day process. Just to recruit 1 employee, the company has to take interviews with 100s of candidates. Many profiles will be irrelevant but still, HR has to waste his time reviewing those applications. A robot comes in handy to pick the top few candidates who are the best fit for the role. This will make HR’s job easy in recruiting the best candidate without wasting much time.' },
        { id: 4, title: 'Benefits and Compensation', content: 'An employee needs a justification when it comes to his share of benefits and compensation. With a robot in the picture, there can be complete transparency in this process. This will help build trust with the employees and immediate response to queries can be handled.' },
        { id: 5, title: 'Data Management', content: 'A constant change in labor laws makes life difficult for the HR department as they have to adapt afresh rules. And to keep up with the pace of changing laws, HR department can implement RPA to the difficult processes as it can easily adapt to changes with adjustments in the rules. This makes it simpler for organizations to obey to compliance laws. So much time is saved as error-free reports are automatically created by adding information from different sources. With one Robot in place, all these data can be easily handled with high accuracy. Also, the data can be edited, updated, or deleted easily providing a transparent approach to employee data. A robot can be used to record an employee’s data, get people analytics, do data cleansing regularly, and interact with different functions within an organization.' },
        { id: 6, title: 'HR compliance management & Reporting', content: 'Rules, Guidelines, and Laws of companies and countries keep changing from time to time. Framing the policy guidelines and informing all the employees regarding this is a time-consuming job. Also, each employee can raise queries that need to answer immediately. Such policy awareness can be integrated with a Robot. A bot can give a personalized message transfer to all the employees and answer all their queries. Also, consistency can be maintained across the organization about compliance and policies.' },
        { id: 7, title: 'Mergers and Acquisition', content: 'Mergers and Acquisition requires a lot of changes in organization design and structure. Also, the chaos that accompanies a Merger or an Acquisition should be handled immediately. With the RPA process, such scenarios can be handled very smoothly allowing all the board of directors and the employees to know the current state of the company. It can also bridge the gap between various policy-related, employment-related and client-related data. An RPA not only helps in saving time but also saves money and manpower in the process.' },
        { id: 8, title: 'Monitoring Time and Absences', content: 'Most of the MNCs are already using biometrics for tracking the attendance of the employee. With RPA, we can understand the trends of the employee’s attendance using RPA Analytics. Also, a manager can keep a track of time-conscious employees, employees who are taking leaves on regular patterns, and the overall picture of his team’s leave calendar. A robot can validate the data and inform HR if there is any discrepancy in the data.' },
        { id: 9, title: 'Recruitment and Onboarding', content: 'Recruitment is a big process for any company. It involves a lot of paperwork, data entry of new hires, selection criteria, and onboarding of new hires. The HR team should be well aware of the attrition rate in their company. A robot can enhance the process of gathering the employee’s data, updating it, and maintaining the data across the organization. It not only makes the process accurate but also fills gaps in between various functionality. With analytical data generated by the robot, the board of directors can engage in structuring the roles and responsibilities within the company.' },
        { id: 10, title: 'Payroll Automation', content: 'Most payrolls in an organization are rule-based, involving a large volume of data that are repetitive, they make the best case to involve the RPA process to take care of it. As payroll is a sensitive subject to employees, a bot can guarantee 100% accuracy in maintaining the data with less time consumption. With RPA, data consistency can be checked with the ERP system along with tracking paychecks, rewards, reimbursements, and benefits being submitted inaccurately or with delays.' }

                                Human Resource Automation is a trending technology that many companies are vouching for. Around 40% of the companies have already implemented robots for HR processes. If a company is having 10000- 100000 employees, maintaining each employee’s database, recording their timesheets, maintaining and crediting their salary records and many other HR activities consume a lot of time and manpower. Also, a single error may lead to a lot of chaos within the organization. With HR automation, one robot can be used to manage all these activities with high accuracy and provide output within a few seconds. Also, such robots, when used, can be made to work round the clock (24*7*365).

                                HR is a cost centric field in any organization. With HR Automation, an HR employee can be given more strategical and decision making roles rather than wasting their energy in manual processes.

                                The world is moving towards digitization with Automation technology creating the buzz. Every functionality within an organization is replacing manpower with Robots. Human Resource Department is not behind when it comes to adapting Automation technology. Many organizations have already implemented Automation in the field of People Analytics, Recruitment process, Employee Data management, and others.

Hence, the HR team’s significance in an organization is considered quite high. But, HRs spend most of their time in recording and maintaining the database. Such situations call for Automation processes to take charge. Some repetitive activities, follow some particular sequence of steps, and handle bulk data can be replaced by a Bot.
