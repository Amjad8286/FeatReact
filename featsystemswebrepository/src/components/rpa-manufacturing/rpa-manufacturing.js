                                    <li>As most of the deliveries can happen globally, a company has to keep a record of compliance in different cities and countries and be up-to-date with any changes in compliance.

                            Robotics Process Automation (RPA) is the next silver bullet in the Manufacturing industry. A manufacturing industry that wants to unbox the full potential of their production capacity, administration and management, should apparently consider using the RPA in their functional area.

The employees in manufacturing industry should refer the record document to get detailed data and information. Then they can able to get an idea of what to purchase, where to purchase, how to purchase and when to purchase. This is the most distressing part of the manufacturing industry. If any error happens, this will lead to an enormous loss in the industry. By using the RPA in this unit will give the organizations and companies a chance to create the product with; Better data accuracy, much faster, and this product formation should be completed on time.</p>

                                The important part in business that brings success is the customer service. And Robotics Process Automation (RPA) can be beneficial in the front office for enhanced communication with the customer. RPA will be used as an alert reminder while employee checks out with customers and also maintain the contact schedule and it will trigger to employees, if a customer has raised a complaint. In the front office, an employee should navigate multiple systems in real-time while answering single customer to access the multiple data from various systems. When setting up RPA, we can access multiple stored data at one place and with better customer service.

                                Data migration is moving data from an old system to newly restored system. RPA is the perfect choice for migration of data from one place to another. When a company acquires new business, they should have a book of their own business policy. Even the migration data for a small matter takes a long time and great costs. With proper preparation and presentation of the RPA will definitely reduce the long wait time and high costs too.

                                The assimilation of RPA in Enterprise resource planning (ERP) could be the next stage in planning resources. The reports, like storage level, Pricing, Accounts Payable and Receivable, and other reports are automatically created and you can upload it in a share point folder or automate them to send via email. In storage area, manufacturing employees can supervise the current stock level and notify ERP when the stock is low. Then ERP can automate them to reorder again. They can also mass update the stock keeping unit (SKU) automatically.
