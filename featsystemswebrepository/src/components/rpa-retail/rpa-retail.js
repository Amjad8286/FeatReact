                                    <li> Retail Industry is growing exponentially in the last decade. With E-commerce becoming very popular, customers are experiencing a different retail experience with a lot of variety to choose from. </li>
                                    <li> E-commerce has made many companies enter the retail business increasing the competition in the market. Hence, retaining customers to one retail store has kept all retail industries on their toes.</li>
                                    <li> Before, Retail industries followed a push strategy wherein they would stock the inventory and then push those products to the customers. But, in todayâ€™s world, retailers use a pull strategy where a customer places an order and then the supply chain is triggered to make the order reach the customer on time.</li>
                                    <li> Hence, retailers have to make use of a lot of customer analytics, work on ERP systems, workflow management, and be up-to-date on customer reviews and feedback. Without the help of automation, these tasks seem to be very tedious and impossible at times for the retailers to cope up with and stand against the competitors.</li>
