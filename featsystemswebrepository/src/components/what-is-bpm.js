                                    The full form of <strong>(BPM)</strong> is <strong>Business Process Automation</strong> a technology that can add value to any companies as it focuses on the optimization of business operations. It follows a top-down approach aiming at increasing efficiency and achieving business goals. Well defined and documented processes organize the business through BPM and manage process lifecycles. Flexibility to quickly respond to agile conditions in a competitive landscape is the top-of-the-list benefit for implementing BPM in a workplace.

                                        Companies perform different steps to implement BPM. It is noted that there are certainly innumerable life cycles and each expert has his own variant. What they all have in common is that processes are optimized.

                                        <li><strong>Analyze-</strong> The first thing is to examine/analyze the existing processes. This involves identifying the process that has the possibility of improvement. It is about the design of processes that should ideally exist.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Design / Modeling-</strong> Based on the documentation made for the process mentioned. The target processes are well structured, modeled, detailed, agreed and established.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Implement / Execute-</strong> The step of execution involves the integration of the newly designed and modeled process. The manual, partial, or fully automated execution of&nbsp;the processes is carried by the bot. In this, the improved process was further implemented.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Monitor-</strong> Monitoring includes the tracking of each process. It provides the status details and the output statistics of one or more processes to measure efficiency and pinpoint bottlenecks.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Manage / Optimize-</strong> This process involves retrieving the performance information from step and identifying the bottlenecks, potential opportunities, cost savings, or other areas of improvement and then using those changes in the process design.</li>

                                    <h2 className="bassHead">Role of BPM in process optimization and automation</h2>
                                    <p className="bassTxt">Ideally, Process Management deals with monitoring and optimizing existing processes along with analyzing the scope of new processes. Usually, companies use manual work steps to handle BPM. But with digitization, can such processes be bound by technology?</p>

                                    <p className="bassTxt">The answer is yes! Automation of the BPM process has been shown to increase the profitability and customer focus in many companies as it focuses on optimizing process quality.</p>

                                    <p className="bassTxt">Modern technologies like <strong>“Robotic Process Automation”</strong> and <strong>“Artificial Intelligence”</strong> have contributed to automating BPM processes to a great extent. RPA process automates the manual, repetitive process that primarily focuses on classic administrative tasks. AI in the other hand evaluates unstructured data and performs a subsequent analysis. Hence, such processes get implemented can reduce the manual dependency of employees and utilize such resources for more value-adding activities.</p>

                                    <p className="bassTxt">Hence, integrating AI and RPA with the BPM process will create new business models with the main role of optimizing business processes.</p>

                                    <p className="bassTxt">The goal of BPM is to provide a clear picture of the internal process for the company. These processes are regularly analyzed to achieve consistent improvements.</p>
