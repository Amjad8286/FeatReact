                                    Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a software technology that automates structured, rule-based procedures and can be basically be performed by virtual robots. These robots imitate human interaction with a software system and work as a human on the user interface in a similar way.

                                    Even though the word Automation was coined in the 1950s, very few are completely aware of what Robotics and Automation are all about. As the entire world is progressing towards a technologically driven process, Automation is the new trend in this process. Let us completely understand “What is RPA”, how does it work, and various other factors that affect Robotic Automation.

                                    Robotic Process Automation is a software tool that is used to mimic human activities that use computer applications to deliver business processes. Software code is optimized according to the workflow and a virtual robot is created which is used to communicate and integrate different web/windows/other applications. The input is captured through the customized User Interface, the robot uses this input to complete the activity as per guidelines and instructions predefined and finally, the output is displayed on the UI mostly as reports. Robot Automation is predominantly used to perform a repetitive task that contains a large volume of data. It can be used for any process and can handle multiple processes across different domains.

                                            Start the project by clearly defining which activity or process requires automation. The defined activity should have an input, a sequence of steps to be performed to generate an output that can be measured. Once the workflow design is created, it becomes easy to implement the Robotic automation Tool.

                                <ol>

                                        <p>
                                            Attended RPA bots are designed to handle Automation workflows which require continuous interaction between human and bots. Here, a software bot behaves similarly to a digital assistant to an employee mimicking human activities that focus on certain rule-based standards.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The best example that can be quoted for Attended Bots is customer service providers. When a customer calls an agent, he can use a bot to fill up customer information. After listening to the customer’s query, the agent can trigger the bot which will continue the process of generating the ticket and sending it to the concerned department. Hence, an agent has to focus on decision-making tasks and allow the Robot to complete the remaining rule-based repetitive tasks.

                                            After identifying the process, we subject the processes to our tool to understand the feasibility and reliability of the selected automation process.

                                            We develop a Proof of Concept (POC) and run a pilot workflow for the identified automation workflows.

                                            After getting the expected results from Pilot runs, we completely design the automation flow for the Robots to work on.

                                            The bots are fed into the RPA orchestrator queues and they are trained to automate the process as per the workflow design created.

                                            Once, the bots start giving the expected results, the team monitors the process workflow to minimize the errors and provide 100% accurate results. Also, post-production support is providing continuously for the smooth functioning of the process.

                                    RPA Robotic Process Automation is a tool that can be used to replace most of the business processes within a company. Major RPA companies like Accenture, Cisco, PwC, Deloitte, Genpact, Harley Davidson, etc. use Robotic Process Automation software extensively in their workflows. The major applications which can be replaced by RPA can be listed as below:

                                            Data can be extracted from an application and added to other applications. This can be majorly used in the Insurance and Banking domains.

                                            An RPA bot can easily handle employee’s details like salary, designation, incentives, work progress, and other HR-related information.
